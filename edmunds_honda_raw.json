I upgraded to this car from a 2006 Honda Accord. Keeping my cars for several years, I require my vehicles to be dependable. That's why I stuck with Honda. My 2006 Accord was a great car that gave me zero problems for ten years. It only had 115k miles on it but I wanted something new. Needless to say, upgrading to a 2017 model, was a no-brainer. With that being said, even though I enjoy my new Accord, it's not perfect. I'm not achieving the advertised mpg of 26 city. I'm averaging closer to 21/22 in town. I use the Econ feature and keep it in \"D\" not \"S\" mode, so I'm not sure why my mpg is slow low. Could using the heater lower the mpg that much? Hmm... Perhaps I still need to break it in.  However, city driving is a joy. Not only is the car comfortable, easy and fun to drive, I'm noticing other drivers breaking their necks to check it out. It's a nice feeling to see others taking notice of this attractive car. For a practical midsize sedan, I think it looks great!  The interior screams luxury with the red stitched black leather interior and cool dash.  The speedometer features a color ring that changes from white to green when you reach efficient driving. I mean, whaaat?!? I don't have the dual-screen infotainment, but I'm glad about that. It just seems too much. I don't think I'd use it that much anyway.  The audio speakers are average at best. You'd think Honda would install better than average speakers but again, nothing's perfect. The car drives a little different at higher speeds. It seems I have to \"control\" the car more than my old 2006 model. It kinda wants to veer a bit on the highway, making for a little less comfortable ride. Are the 19\" wheels the culprit?  You tell me. Overall, I'm very happy with my 2017 Honda Accord Sport Special Edition. It's a beautiful, fun and quality made car which I look forward to driving over the next ten years.", "ratings": {"value": 0, "comfort": 0, "reliability": 0, "technology": 0, "safety": 0, "performance": 0, "interior": 0}, "score": 5.0, "vehicle_type": "2017 Honda Accord  Sport Special Edition 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT)"}, {"recommend_count": {"down": 0, "up": 0}, "date": "01/30/17 10:38 AM (PST)", "author": "Janice L.", "helpful_count": "0/0", "title": "Love my Honda", "best_features": ["Acceleration", "Road holding", "Braking", "Shifting", "Steering", "Rear seats", "Noise and vibration", "Front seats", "Ride comfort", "Instrumentation", "Quality of materials", "Cargo storage", "Logic of controls", "Interior design", "Active safety", "Headlights", "Parking aids", "Entertainment", "Dealership support", "Engine", "Transmission", "Electronics", "Purchase cost", "Fuel economy"], "worst_features": [], "content": "Buena Park Honda is the best dealer.

Driving comfort is marginal at best the car is prone to wind noise and if you are driving on anything that has the least amount of bumpiness  to the surface you will feel it in your kidneys.  All these short comings could be over looked except for the first statement in this review all show NO-GO! This car is equipped with the most powerful I-4 available in the  accord but still makes less than 200 horse power.  the engine isn't the issue however because when coupled with the manual gear box as I found out later the car can come alive.  The problem with the car is the CVT transmission this thing is junk and the worst part is I paid an extra two grand to get it over the 6 speed manual.  The CVT transmission makes this car feel like it is in a constant state of slippage don't pull out in traffic if to have a car coming because you will most likely not make it.  want to pass someone good luck your stuck behind that person doing 10 under on a two lane road because the car accelerates so slowly.  Sure you will eventually get to speed but it will take you awhile.  speaking of taking awhile 0-60 times on this car have been exaggerated to say the least plan on spending just over 10 seconds to get from 0-60MPH in drive mode, you will spend 9.89 seconds going 0-60 in sport mode and the best but still poor using the paddle  shifters you will eek out the best time of 8.96 seconds 0-60.  a far cry from the advertised 0-60 time of 7.5 seconds.  But hey we didn't buy the accord to race we bought it for fuel economy right? While it would be nice to be able to pass grandma on a two lane without risking sudden death, if time is on your side than by all means get an accord at an average 32MPG driving with the eco button on.  This would be my only reason to keep the accord but don't buy the sport version without the manual as you will just feel like crap getting passed by everything in sight and have no ability to do anything  about it .", "ratings": {"value": 0, "comfort": 0, "reliability": 0, "technology": 0, "safety": 0, "performance": 0, "interior": 0}, "score": 2.0, "vehicle_type": "2017 Honda Accord  Sport Special Edition 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT)"}, {"recommend_count": {"down": 0, "up": 0}, "date": "12/31/16 08:23 AM (PST)", "author": "Mike Morgan", "helpful_count": "0/0", "title": "Honda lover", "best_features": ["Acceleration", "Braking", "Rear seats", "Front seats", "Cargo storage", "Outward visibility", "Headlights", "Entertainment", "Fuel economy"], "worst_features": [], "content": "Just purchased a 2017 Accord Touring.

After 30'years of driving Hondas, My 2017 Accord does not live up to Honda quality. My last Accord a 2013 was a much better car. The new car has a shudder in the steering at highway speeds that is not correctable. The steering is also unstable. With no surface interference (wind, road crown) the car will not go straight. It floats and needs continuous correction. Honda's suspension retuning has apparently failed.'The dealer has balanced and aligned wheels, replaced all tires and tried other cars of the same trim line and they all exhibit the same idiosyncrasies. Very sad. I have an iPhone SE with 10.1.1 which pairs fine with the Bluetooth Handsfreelink, however the connectivity is horrible. It rarely takes an audio command, often does not pick up a call, cuts in and out rendering it unusable. After many calls to Honda and Apple I Have given up. Back to handheld. Very sad. The back up camera was improperly installed and replaced but it is such an inferior optic it is useless at night and sketchy in daylight. No more Hondas for me. I am not a big fan of the style change either but the basics, drivability and technology are safety issues that are unforgivable for Honda.

I will only say what I don't like about this car. Exterior- Rear trunk is flimsy. Honeycomb front grill is difficult to clean and keep clean.Sunroof is too small. Headlights on low beam do not shine far enough. Interior is worse! The leather they use seems more like vinyl, not good quality. The sound system is abysmal. The back up camera and side view camera are very pixlelated. All the fancy things the dash screen can do , can only be done while in park. There is no gauge on the tires for individual tire pressure , only a dummy light. You can't dim the dash screen lights only turn them off( too bright). The apple car play/ Android feature only works if your phone is plugged into the usb port. It will not work with blue tooth. Now I do like the memory seat feature and the cool led light that shines down on the center console. Over all this care for this price shoud be better.

I was ready to buy another impala.   But the new impalas, while they had a four cylinder available, really needed a v six.   The fuel economy with that was dismal.  18 mpg in city.  Nevertheless i had picked out the model, trim packages and colr i wanted.  Priced it using all dicounts rebates etc.   then i decided what the heck , let me look at a honda accord.  Test drove.  Whoa.  More acceleration than the impala that had a six cylinder.  This accord has a four cylinder in it?  With acceleration like that!  Then i checked some pavkages and trim levels.  This accord cost me 6000 less than a comparably equipped impala.  It has 27 mpg in city and 35 or more on highway.  I am. Averaging over 31 combined after 1100 miles.  The Accord has a much bigger back seat than the impala.  The trunk in impala is bigger, yes, but accord has plenty of trunk soace, golf clubs fit with no problem.  The passenger front seat is not as comfortable for my wife as the impala.  Except for that this car is awesome.   Test drive one, look at the price...i still think chevy makes great cars, but I am 6-3 and dont want a makibu, hard to fit in.
